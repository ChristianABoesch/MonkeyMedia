      <h2>Hello and welcome to Monkey Media. We specialize in monkeying around haha just kidding but seriously we specialize in media, particularly generating media and getting it to sound exactly how we want it to, using the workings of artificial intelligence.</h2>
      <h3>All you gotta do is generate audio by adding as many details as you'd like the audio to have, and then I guess you can have it saved as a "monkey". You can go back and edit your monkey as often as desired, and create new ones from entirely new ideas or concepts. <span class="pity">You can even send your monkey to others on the site and they can make edits on yours and send it back, AND VICE VERSA.</span> So whatcha waitin for? Get building on a mokney today or whatever</h3>

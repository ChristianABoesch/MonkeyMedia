  <h1>So why monkeys?</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <p>We get this question a lot. Like, un poco mucho. But we'll answer it here so that nobody asks again. We wanted something catchy and tastefully associative that we could use to represent the things you can create. So we as a team agreed on monkeys because:</p>
    <li>They're cute</li>
    <li>They're sometimes small</li>
    <li>They perform tasks that you ask it to</li>
    <li>They can interact with each other like how monkeys do in nature</li>
    <li>They're cute again</li>
    <li>Other stuff</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>We've tried other animals, but reviewers didn't take very kindly to any of them. So monkeys had to do. That being said, we hope you're pleased with our choice. Now get off of this page, there's nothing else for you here</p>
